Points to be noted.
- Try to use camelCase while naming variables in any file.
- Try to use the same theme and color of the original website.
- We work on MySql v5.6 Try to make your code compatible with this version.
- Hosted on AWS EC2 linux server, make sure to write any PHP system related commands for linux OS.
- Make sure your code is compatible with PHP v7.2
- Try to use relative adressing for files. I case you need the absolute adress use /var/www/pesu/ as the document root
- www-data is not a root user for secirity purposes. Therefore don't try to use any root OS level instructions in PHP
